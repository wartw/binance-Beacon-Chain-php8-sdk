# binance-php-sdk

This repository contains the PHP-SDK to interact with [Binance DEX](http://binance.org). It's supported by mostly pure PHP code. The documentation for Binance DEX supported methods is [here](http://docs.binance.org).

## Installation

At the moment, you will have to clone the repo and include it in your project. In the future, it will be available through composer.

The SDK relies on [secp256k1-php8](https://github.com/wartw/secp256k1-php8). There is currently no easy method to install secp256k1-php extension, you will need compile it yourself.

### To Install:

libsecp256k1:

    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git && \
    cd secp256k1 &&                                    \
    ./autogen.sh &&                                    \
    ./configure --enable-experimental --enable-module-{ecdh,recovery} && \
     make &&                                           \
     sudo make install &&                              \
     cd ../
secp256k1-php:

    git clone https://github.com/wartw/secp256k1-php.git && \
    cd secp256k1-php/secp256k1 &&                      \
    phpize &&                                          \ 
    ./configure --with-secp256k1 &&                    \  
    make && sudo make install &&                       \
    cd ../../

## (Optional) - Enable extension by default!
If you're a heavy user, you can add this line to your php.ini files for php-cli, apache2, or php-fpm.

> extension=secp256k1.so

The repository was made on Mac OSX using PHP version `7.15.3`. You will also need a version above 7. It is advised to go with native PHP installation instead of going with XAMPP or WAMPP so to take advantage of secp256k1-php natively. Also, you may need `gmp` extension.

To handle big numbers, the SDK makes use of [brick/math](https://github.com/brick/math) precision library. Please consider using this or another `bcmath` or `gmp` based solutions while dealing with blockchain based numbers.

## Examples

**Note:** Please see [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hammadtq/binance-php-sdk/blob/master/issuetracker.md) to understand what methods are currently available in the sdk. 

You can find full [example](https://github.com/hammadtq/binance-php-sdk/tree/master/src/Examples) scripts in the src folder.

Few examples to interact with SDK are below:

### Keystore reload and getting private key

```php
$keystoreData = '{paste keystore data here or read from a file}';
$keystore= new Keystore();
$keystore->RestoreKeyStore($keystoreData, "{keystore-password}", "tbnb");
$privateKey = $keystore->getPrivateKey();
```

Similary, if you want to see the hex of private key, simply use this method:

`$keystore->getPrivateKey()->getHex();`

### A typical transfer request will look something like this:

```php
$bncClient = new BncClient('https://data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org');
$bncClient->initChain();
$bncClient->chooseNetwork("testnet"); // or this can be "mainnet"
$bncClient->setPrivateKey($privateKey);
$response = $bncClient->transfer("tbnb1yqyppmev2m4z96r4svwtjq8eqp653pt6elq33r", "tbnb1hgm0p7khfk85zpz5v0j8wnej3a90w709zzlffd", 0.001, "BNB", "3423423");
```

### Placing an order

```php
$response = $bncClient->NewOrder("BNB_USDT.B-B7C", 1, 0.001, 1, 0, 1); //Symbol, side, price, quantity, sequence, timeinfore
```

## Amino Encoding

The SDK uses Google [proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) generator to support Binance's aminor encoding/decoding. If you ever include new messages to the [proto file](https://github.com/hammadtq/binance-php-sdk/tree/master/proto), run following command to run the generator from the root:

`protoc --proto_path=proto --php_out=./gen proto/dex.proto`

## Key Generation

Key generation is supported via secp256k1-php library as well. 

Once you generate an address, make sure to send an amount on it as the Binance DEX will not make an account unless a transaction is received on an address.

```php
$keystore = new Keystore();
$privateKey = Byte::init($keystore->createPrivateKey());
$publicKey = $keystore->createPublicKey($privateKey);
$address = $keystore->publicKeyToAddress($publicKey, 'tbnb');
```

## Supported Methods

* Keypair generation
* Keypair generation with mnemonic
* Keystore reload
* Fetching JSON-RPC functions
* Fetch API functions
* Transactions: Transfer, NewOrder, CancelOrder, TokenFreeze, TokenUnFreeze, Issue, Mint, Burn, HTLT, DepositHTLT, ClaimHTLT, RefundHTLT, TimeLock, TimeRelock, TimeUnlock
